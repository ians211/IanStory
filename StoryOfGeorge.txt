There once was a boy named George. He was having the best Saturday of his 
childHood. Eating ice cream, watching cartoons, his mom even made him a 
cheeseburger. Everything was going great...until he got a notification on his
phone: Email! - It read. He checked his email and saw that it was from Debra
Deppeler...


Debra Depperler was emailing to assign a secret task to George. The secret 
task was to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death
Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
