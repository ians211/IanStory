There once was a boy named George. He was having the best Saturday of his 
childHood. Eating ice cream, watching cartoons, his mom even made him a 
cheeseburger. Everything was going great...until he got a notification on his
phone: Email! - It read. He checked his email and saw that it was from Debra
Deppeler...


Debra Depperler was emailing to assign a secret task to George. The secret 
task was to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death
Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. 

George had no idea how Deb could've found out that in his past he was a secret
agent. He had been undercover as a college student for years, and was really
enjoying it, but he guessed it was time to go back to his ways. He and Deb
journeyed to the space station, and both of their lives were about to change.
